## About The Project

This project is a game that can be played by 4 players. It consists of a main screen that displays the current scores and penalties for each player. The players take turns selecting numbers and hitting a "penalty" button if they cannot select a number. The game ends when all players have completed their turns.
## Features

<ul>
  <li>Dynamic UI that changes in real-time as the players take their turns</li>
  <li>Ability for players to reset the session</li>
  <li>The game allows for a maximum of 4 players to play</li>
  <li>Players can select numbers in ascending or descending order</li>
  <li>Ability to hit a penalty button if a player cannot select a number</li>
</ul>

## Technical Details

The game is built using Only JavaScript DOM.<br>
The JavaScript code creates the UI elements dynamically and adds event listeners to them.<br>
The game state is stored using session storage, so it can be persisted even if the player refreshes the page.
